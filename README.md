## Inspiration
Our inspiration was an old flash game that a bunch of us used to play back in the day. We decided to make it our own and everyone has their own little piece in the game.

## What it does
This 2D soccer game allows you and one friend to go head-to-head in a best of 7 soccer match. The left player uses "WASD" and "Space" while the right player uses "Arrows" and "M".

## How we built it
This game was built on Unity. We used a 2D game template.

## Challenges we ran into
Almost all of us have never used Unity or developed a game so it was a challenge to learn the technology but we are very proud with what we learned in 24 hours!

## What we learned
We learned how to divide the work up and make sure everyone had a large part in the project. As we had people from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Industrial Design, Foster Care Case Worker, and an 8th grade student it was a challenge and learning experience for everyone!

This was the first time any of us have ever made a 2D Unity game from scratch. We all learned so much about Unity itself as well as game development.

## What's next for Fat Foot Feetball
Improve the graphics, physics, and add new cool powerups!

## Built With
C#, paint.net, piskelapp.com, Unity
